This is a graphical simulation of three atoms (Hydrogen, Carbon, and Phosphorus) on the periodic table done for CSE423 project. The atoms will consist of a nucleus and multiple orbits with electrons. The electrons will revolve along the orbits centering the nucleus. Electrons, orbits, and nuclei will be drawn using the Midpoint Circle Drawing algorithm. Additionally, the charges will be drawn using the Midpoint Line Drawing algorithm. There will be buttons for the atoms consisting of symbols with atomic numbers as subscripts. When the key with the symbol is pressed on the keyboard, the respective button will be highlighted. Then if the mouse is clicked on the screen, it will generate the atomic model on that specific coordinate.
